# Abrahan's Portfolio
## Purpose of this repo
This repo is meant to house my personal site. 
It is built in ASP.NET Core and meant to be very flexible in terms of design as well with various templates that can be enabled or disabled using various variables.

## Modifying
* To modify the bulk of the site, modify "index.cshtml" in the pages folder
* To modify the footer, modify "_Layout.cshtml" in the shared folder.

## How to run it
* This uses ASP.NET to build, and thus requires you to check out .NET Core. 
* Once installed, simply run dotnet watch run to run the site and navigate to https://localhost:5001/.
